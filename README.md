Welcome! 

This is a minimal book about probability: what you need to know to not
be completely mental when it comes to statistics.

Long before Leo Breiman famously bemoaned the fact that statisticians were
so enthralled by irrelevant statistical theory that they were incapable answering the
call for data analysis help from a world inundated with data of all shapes and sizes
[@Breiman:2001aa], Leo Breiman studied the science that is at the foundation of
statistical thinking, probability.  And while he was giving his lectures
on applied probability to a small class of graduate students, he often paced the
front of the class and asked "where's the randomness?" or "where's the randomness
coming from?".  I have never heard any other statistics professor ask that question.
It was as if to everyone else, randomness was a given - it was wherever you needed
it to be to accommodate your statistical method of choice.  Leo Breiman, on the
other hand, was all too aware that the magic of random variability which often
can be harnessed to great benefit can only be relied on when certain conditions 
were met.  He knew the magic of probability theory, but he also knew its limits
