	abstract = {This chapter describes a variety of ways in which probabilistic simulation can be used to better understand statistical procedures in general, and the fit of models to data in particular. In Sections 8.1--8.2, we discuss fake-data simulation, that is, controlled experiments in which the parameters of a statistical model are set to fixed ``true''values, and then simulations are used to study the properties of statistical methods. Sections 8.3--8.4 consider the related but different method of predictive simulation, where a model is fit to data, then replicated datasets are simulated from this estimated model, and then the replicated data are compared to the actual data.The difference between these two general approaches is that, in fake-data simulation, estimated parameters are compared to true parameters, to check that a statistical method performs as advertised. In predictive simulation, replicated datasets are compared to an actual dataset, to check the fit of a particular model.Fake-data simulationSimulation of fake data can be used to validate statistical algorithms and to check the properties of estimation procedures. We illustrate with a simple regression model, where we simulate fake data from the model, y = α+ βx + ∊, refit the model to the simulated data, and check the coverage of the 68{\%} and 95{\%} intervals for the coefficent β.},

@book{Gelman:2020aa,
	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.},

@article{Gelman:2004aa,
	abstract = {"Exploratory" and "confirmatory" data analysis can both be viewed as methods for comparing observed data to what would be obtained under an implicit or explicit statistical model. For example, many of Tukey's methods can be interpreted as checks against hypothetical linear models and Poisson distributions. In more complex situations, Bayesian methods can be useful for constructing reference distributions for various plots that are useful in exploratory data analysis. This article proposes an approach to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. These ideas are developed in the context of examples from fields including psychology, medicine, and social science.},

@book{Gelman:2006aa,
	abstract = {Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models, first published in 2007, is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout.},
